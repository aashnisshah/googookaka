GOO GOO KA KA
--------------------------------

This year, the GMD theme is "if a thing is worth doing, it is worth doing badly".
My game, Goo Goo Ka Ka falls in this theme since it is making fun of a Youtube video where a Giant Eagle started picking up a little child in a park. This video can be found at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEWc8yDhU8Y. If you're making fun of things, you can always do it by turning it into a game right?

Brief Description:
---------------------------------

This is a two player game where you are either the Eagle or the Baby. 
As the eagle, your objective is to get the child. To do this, you need to collect food by eating the birds and get strength. Each bird provides you with different amounts of strength. When you have more than 100 strength, you can attack the child. You can also collect "blocks" and drop them to block the babies path. Capture the child before the time runs out or you lose.
As the baby, your objective is to avoid the eagle at all costs. You can eat candy to get energy for a speed boost (needs over 100 energy). You can also collect milk bottles to get milk shots. Every time you hit the Eagle with a milk shot, the Eagle loses 150 strength.

Special Features:
---------------------------------

The following special features may be perceived as bugs - they are not though :)
1. When pressing the "Pause" or "Help" buttons during Game Play, the screen seems to "glitch" or "spas"
2. When playing, if either player goes to the edges (where there is an invisible wall), or if the baby gets stuck next to a block, the player could continuously hit a direction arrow key and get through the block/wall and continue on to the other side. This could be fixed by making certain changes in the collision and movement codes in a possible future release of the game.
